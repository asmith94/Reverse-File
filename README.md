# Reverse-File

This is a demonstration of a few different aspects of Java, mainly the util and I/O as well as one of the most useful data structures; ArrayLists.

The assignment from the textbook was the following:

"Write a program to reverse the lines of a file and also to reverse the order of the words in each line of the file. You should use ArrayLists to help you."
